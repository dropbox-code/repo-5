# Template for Vapor Applications

This is a template to bootstrap a Vapor application using vapor toolbox.

This template is based on the [vapor original one](https://github.com/vapor/template) with small improvements to the Dockerfile and other process that we use on our projects.

## How to use it

`vapor new <name> --template https://github.com/ydataai/vapor-template`

## .github folder

Contains the workflows used in the pipelines to validate, test and build a docker for the application.
